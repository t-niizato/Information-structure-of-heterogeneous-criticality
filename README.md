## demo file
The user can check the IIT animation with different group integrity (direction and speed) for all $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ conditions.

Run PHI_real_fish.py with Python files (Python 3.9 recommended).

Select the data number from 0~6.

## IIT computation from raw datasets

We listed sample raw data for IIT computation in MATLAB 2020b.

Before running our program, please import the practical PHI toolbox \url{https://github.com/oizumi-lab/PhiToolbox}.

Run Main_Complex_Computation (MIP_computation).

## Figures

The reader can check our results (Figure 2~5) from Figures.mlx.

Please connect the paths before running the above program.
